Script Explanation
The script performs the following steps:

Load the Data: Reads the dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.

Extract Features and Target Variable: Extracts the SAT scores as the feature (X) and the GPA as the target variable (y).

Perform Linear Regression: Fits a linear regression model to the data using Scikit-Learn's LinearRegression model.

Plot the Data and Regression Line: Plots the original data points and the regression line using Matplotlib.

Print Slope and Intercept: Prints the slope and intercept of the regression line.

Example Output
When you run the script, it will output a plot showing the data points and the regression line. Additionally, it will print the slope and intercept of the regression line in the console.
